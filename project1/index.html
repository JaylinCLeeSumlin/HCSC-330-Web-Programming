                <p>
                    Web programming started as just another high school elective. I only registered because I needed a
                    first-period class before my Python course (which was during second-period). Taking a first-period
                    class was required to have a half-day schedule and was the only interesting course after Intro to
                    Womenâ€™s Studies was removed from our curriculum. Still, web programming held no real significance to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I entered college, I knew I needed to eventually find which path of CS I wanted to take. Nothing
                    seemed as interesting and creative to me as web programming. It is the ultimate use of creativity and
                    logistics; the perfect mix for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the underclassmen courses at Clark Atlanta do not offer web programming. Still, I
                    persisted in my desire to learn more about the art behind creating websites. Luckily, I am able to
                    take a class in my final year as an undergrad.
